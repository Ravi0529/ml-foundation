# What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression (also called Logit Regression) is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class (e.g., what is the probability that this email is spam?). If the estimated probability is greater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class (called the positive class, labeled “1”), and otherwise it predicts that it does not (i.e., it belongs to the negative class, labeled “0”). This makes it a binary classifier.

## Key Concepts of Logistic Regression

### 1. Estimating Probabilities

### 2. Training and Cost Function

### 3. Decision Boundaries

### 4. Softmax Regression (Multinomial Logistic Regression)
